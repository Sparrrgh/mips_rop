_Find ROP gadgets in MIPS_

## Description:
Adaptation of [binja_rop](https://github.com/m4ul3r/binja_rop/) to find ROP gadgets in MIPS. Features visualization of the registers controlled for the jumps.
I plan to add the features from IDA's [mipsrop](https://github.com/tacnetsol/ida/tree/master/plugins/mipsrop) in the future
